                        <li>Aral Balkan</li>
                        <li>This is an awesome time to be a developer! The distinction between rich-client web, desktop, and mobile applications is narrowing. Web developers can now build cross-platform desktop apps using web technologies. Mac developers can now develop for the sexiest mobile phone on earth, and you have access to APIs and services that let you map the world, create real-time, multi-user experiences, and augment and expand reality in previously unimaginable ways. Are you excited yet? You've got dynamic, rapid languages and frameworks like Python, Django, PHP, Rails, Objective-C and mature development environments like XCode, Visual Studio, and Eclipse. You have commodity hardware, commodity software, and free access to more information at your fingertips than has ever been available. And you have access to infinitely-scalable utility computing resources the likes of which only the largest corporations have hitherto been able to afford. Yes, this is definitely a wonderful time to a be a developer. Join Aral as he shares with you the tools, technologies, and trends that excite him the most in 2009 and beyond. Get inspired, get motivated, then go out and build the next great thing to add your own page to this most exciting chapter in the history of the Internet.</li>

                <li>Security-Centered Design: Exploring the Impact of Human Behavior
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chris Shiflett</li>
                        <li>Security is more than filtering input and escaping output (FIEO), and it's more than cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgeries (CSRF). Security isn't even always black and white. In order to create a more secure user experience, we need to understand how people think. Perception can be as important as reality, and meeting user expectations is a fundamental of good security. In this multifarious talk, I'll introduce some of what I have learned about cognitive psychology, exploring topics such as change blindness and ambient signifiers, and I'll show some real-world examples that demonstrate the profound impact human behavior can have on security.</li>

                <li>Clouds on the horizon? Get ready for Drizzle
                    <ul>
                        <li>David Axmark</li>
                        <li>The Drizzle project is building a database optimised for Cloud and Internet applications. It is being designed for massive concurrency on modern multi-cpu/core architecture. The code is originally derived from MySQL, the number one database for online applications, and many of the key MySQL developers are involved in the Drizzle project. Join the MySQL founder to find out more about Drizzle, what made MySQL so successful as an online open source database and his involvement with both.</li>

                <li>Sharding Architectures
                    <ul>
                        <li>David Soria Parra</li>
                        <li>High performance web applications often reach the limits of one database server. Such systems require a smart distribution of data. Sharding is a mechanism that helps the application to scale horizontal and gain responsability by splitting information across multiple servers. The talk will give an introduction on sharding and possible implementations as well as covering problems with this approach.</li>

                <li>PHP on Windows - the undiscovered country
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hank Janssen</li>
                        <li>This talk will go over PHP on Windows in the past, present and future, and see what progress has been made. From the almost forgotten child to a now prominent language on Windows. Learn which items Microsoft are currently working on with the PHP community, and see a demo or two of PHP on Windows using current and new technologies. Additionally we will discuss some of the other work the Microsoft Open Source Technology Center has been doing. This overview should give you a good understanding on what has been done, but more importantly provides you with a great feedback mechanism to improve the work the community and Microsoft have been doing with PHP. Hopefully a lot of it will surprise you</li>

                <li>Flex and AIR for PHP programmers
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mihai Corlan</li>
                        <li>The modern day web now features rich Internet applications - all sorts of AJAX frameworks have evolved, resulting in PHP with AJAX sites. Adobe provides alternatives in the form of Flex and AIR. This talk will introduce Flex and AIR to PHP programmers. From what are Flex and AIR, and why should you care, to how you can use existing tools to create these types of projects, and how you can talk and send data back and forth between your PHP server and the Flex/AIR client.</li>

                <li>State Machines to State Of The Art: Smart, efficient design using ReST & MVC
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rowan Merewood</li>
                        <li>Web applications are everywhere now, but many of them misuse the basic concepts laid down by the HTTP protocol, miss the benefits of making the application and the API the same thing, and don't set themselves up to grow if things take off. This talk will look at the design decisions you need to make to ensure that your application really is ReST-ful, how we fit that cleanly into MVC, and how state machines can help us manage clean state changes in a stateless protocol. The talk will go into some of the available design patterns with class diagrams and code snippets showing how and where to implement them.</li>

                <li>What's new in PHP 5.3
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scott MacVicar</li>
                        <li>The newest PHP version, PHP 5.3, introduces a multitude of new language features, most notably namespaces and late static binding, several new extensions such as phar, fileinfo and SQLite3, as well as numerous other improvements to existing features and extensions. Even with all of these new features, it also boasts better performance than older releases. This talk will give attendees a good overview about PHP 5.3 with some code samples showing their use.</li>

                <li>Of Lambda Functions, Closures and Traits
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sebastian Bergmann</li>
                        <li>Lambda functions and closures allow the quick definition of throw-away functions (for use with array_map(), for instance) that are not used elsewhere. Traits reduce some limitations of single inheritance by enabling the reuse method sets freely in several independent classes. This talk introduces the audience to the implementation of lambda functions, closures, and traits for PHP 5.4.</li>

                <li>Myphp-busters: symfony framework
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stefan Koopmanschap</li>
                        <li>The symfony web application framework is a great framework to work with, as most symfony-experienced developers will tell you. It is very reliable and flexible, and allows for fast and structured development, yet those who haven't quite looked at the framework but only know the basics will often tell you symfony is very slow, extremely coupled, and overengineered. So who is telling the truth? This talk will attempt to bust some myphps (pronounce: 'myths') around the symfony framework. Stefan will go into the most common prejudices against symfony, and show you that symfony is actually a bit different than what those people might think.</li>

                <li>Living with Frameworks
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stuart Herbert</li>
                        <li>In the last couple of years, partly in response to Ruby on Rails, frameworks have become the hottest topic in the PHP community. Frameworks are where most of the innovation can be found today, and frameworks rather than language features are driving adoption of PHP worldwide. But what are the longer-term consequences of adopting a framework for your project or your business? In this talk, Stuart will be looking at the lessons he's learnt at Gradwell since they made the decision to adopt a leading PHP framework in 2007. He'll explain why they adopted a framework, what they had to do to make it work, and the many lessons they've learned along the way. The emphasis will be on using frameworks in a business and leadership context, but he will explain some common coding issues too.</li>
