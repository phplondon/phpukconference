    Docker, the hottest technology around at the moment. It swept the Ops world by storm in 2014, became mainstream in 2015, and now it’s set to dominate the developer world, in 2016. Docker is a tool that allows you to package your application up into a single-runnable distributable binary - akin to the phar, but in Hulk mode. Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production. In this tutorial I will pull back the curtain and show you how Docker works and the technologies that make it all possible. We'll dive into Docker Image Layering and optimisation, Docker Networking, Docker Plugins and orchestrating containers at scale with Docker Swarm.

    This workshop prepares web and application developers to build applications with containers, Kubernetes, and OpenShift. It starts with a short introduction to containers and Kubernetes, which are the foundation of OpenShift. Hands-on exercises walk you through a variety of applications and use cases for OpenShift. How about seeing how easy it can be to deploy your prebuilt containers? And how health checks to OpenShift can heal your application? We’ll dig into build containers, using just a Git repository. Want to see easy application scaling? No problem. Wish you could do A/B deployment? Your wish is our command. And finally, you’ll see a complete microservice application with database and polyglot back-end services.

    Since GraphQL was announced by Facebook in 2015 it has started to gain quite a bit of traction with many companies such as Github looking to adopt it to either replace or complement their existing REST APIs. GraphQL provides a powerful way for the frontend to be able to query data sources and your business logic, giving and receiving only the data that they need, without having to always have custom designed endpoints for every use-case. As a consumer of third party APIs it probably won't be long before you're consuming a GraphQL API; and as a designer or creator of APIs, GraphQL can sometimes provide a better alternative than a REST API. Join me for a tour of what GraphQL looks like, what it works well for, how to consume a GraphQL API, and how to easily design and create one in PHP.

    In an increasingly connected world, APIs are key to great tools and effective workflows.  What is better than an API?  A webhook of course!  Webhooks are a key building block of a modern application, allowing systems to exchange data in response to events. This session gives examples of webhooks currently in use ""in the wild"", and examines both when a webhook is useful and the internal design and structuring of webhook payloads.  We'll discuss how to work with webhooks in a scalable way regardless of technology stack; how to recieve and process incoming webhooks from an external system and how to design and publish your own for use by partners or consumers.  Recommended for anyone wanting to teach their applications to play nicely with others.

Understanding this new fundamental compilation step is key to understanding how our code is being run. To demonstrate, James will show how a basic compiler works and how introducing an AST simplifies this process. We’ll look into how these magical time-warp techniques* can also be used in your code to introspect, analyse and modify code in a way that was never possible before. After seeing this talk, you'll have a great insight as to the wonders of an AST, and how it can be applied to both compilers and userland code.<br>(*actual magic or time-warp not guaranteed)

How can we deal with database migrations when we don’t want our end-users to experience downtime, and want to keep releasing? In this talk we’ll discuss non-destructive changes, rollbacks, large data sets, useful tools and a few strategies to migrate our data safely, with minimum disruption to production.

With the rise in popularity of Domain-Driven Design to drive meaning in applications, and our applications becoming increasingly small and "hexagonal", the concept of defining the difference between an Event and a Command is becoming more important. This talk explores using command buses and event dispatchers in combination to clearly segregate the structure, and uses an example of how to use these to create clean CQRS-based applications.

By understanding how the system works in the first place, a lot of issues can be avoided right away. When you have done everything to avoid these pitfalls, you can bring in the big guns: caching. Doctrine has different caching mechanism and since Doctrine 2.5 "Second Level Cache" was added to our toolbox. After this talk, you should know what the impact is of every cache and how to use it.

Symfony flex brings all of the power of full stack Symfony with the upfront requirements of a micro-framework. Choosing Symfony upfront not longer commits you to the overhead you might expect from a traditional Symfony project. See how quickly a new project can be started and how it can evolve over time.

    Buycraft is a multi-tenanted gCommerce platform for Minecraft. Having supported over 500,000 servers around the world, it needs to support a whole range of languages. Centralised i10n sucks - users can't customise it, if the application doesn't have a language file then you can't use that language, and users cannot add their own strings to translate. This is exactly how Buycraft worked - what's a dev to do? Join Liam to find out how Buycraft investigated, hacked and 'borrowed' code to solve this problem to provide a fully flexible, i10n layer for all their customers.

    Alice and Bob have secrets they want to talk about without Eve being able to listen in. Worse yet, the mischievous Mallory delights in changing messages sent between parties. In such a hostile environment how can Alice talk to Bob without their messages being overheard and how can she be sure that it was Bob that sent the message in the first place? This talk will take a brief look at historic codes and ciphers before taking a look at modern day Cryptography. If you want to be able to know the difference between a block cipher and a stream cipher or get a glimpse into the mathematics behind public key Cryptography this talk is for you.
