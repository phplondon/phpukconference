After having some basic information it was time to start a Hackathon and after that something production worthy . In this talk I will try to give the best information to get started and to know some of the problems you can face if you begin event-sourcing.

              Kubernetes is a very powerful container orchestration platform that is quickly gaining traction and gives you lots of benefits in deploying, running and scaling your microservice web application. But it has also a steep learning curve.

              In this workshop you will deploy your first application which consists of multiple Micro-Services to Kubernetes and learn how you can use persistent storage and service meshes and set up sensible monitoring and logging tooling.
