                The world we live in is one where data is one of the most valuable assets. There are many different pieces of data we can analyse on all kind of data from analytics of user behaviour of your platform, user generated content, monitoring of exception rates, or when your core business model is to provide some kind of analytics platform. This talk will talk about how you can, in your Symfony applications, perform some simple trend analysis techniques to build models, analyse data to get useful information and spot anomalies.

            description: As a kid, did you have ambitions for the future? "When I grow up I want to become a ...". Maybe you wanted to become a fireman, an astronaut, a nurse, a teacher, a police officer? As you grow up these ideas evolve and get replaced with actual ambitions, actual hopes and dreams. These might be entirely different than your childhood dreams. But how do you reach these goals? How do you accomplish these dreams? By listening to your parents, friends, or teachers? By doing it yourself? Or maybe you have given up and settled for a watered down version of the career and life you envisioned? People often attribute success to luck, and lack of success to incompetence. But what if I told you it's all about controlling the variables? Luck is something that you can control in a way. The more you figure out the context, the key players, the relationships, the values, and the rules of the ecosystem in which you want to succeed, the easier it is to gain from it. The more variables you control, the easier it is to find potential opportunities and to bank on them. Maybe you didn't get lucky, maybe you just saw it coming, and prepared yourself for it. In this keynote talk, Thijs is going to share his experiences, his hopes, his dreams, and how he applies a positive mental attitude to level up in his career, and in life in general. This is not a growth hacking talk, but a simple set of tips and tricks to succeed, even if it seems like the odds are stacked against you.

            description: Over the years, software teams have questioned if PHP is a good choice for building web services. In this talk, I will share how we use PHP on the backend for Glu Mobile’s flagship mobile game Design Home, enabling it to regularly rank amongst the top free mobile games - both in downloads and grossing - since its launch in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store in Q4 2016. Design Home reaches over 1 million daily active users, serving over 100,000 requests per minute while maintaining a user base of over 30 million players. To date, over 1 billion designs have been made by players. We will deep dive into the thought processes, development, testing and deployment strategy, showcasing what we have achieved with PHP and why we love it and rely on it. My goal is to share with the community that, when done the right way, PHP can be used to build and maintain reliable, massively-scalable and high-performance backends using web services.

            description: 15 years ago, plain text password storing was normal with some using MD5. We look back now and wonder what we were thinking! With GDPR and people thinking more about personal details, its about time we caught up and started storing them securely. There are many uses for personal data and is often sought after by criminals for targeting people. How can you prevent your customers data being used in these attacks ? Encrypting your database is a fantastic way! PHP is the first language to have modern encryption built in to the core, This talk will show you how to use these methods to allow your data to be secure and also not lose the speed which you can currently search for this data in your application. This talk will touch on architecture and will be focused on MySQL although the same techniques can be used for any storage engine.

            description: The blockchain is a hot new topic in the technology due to the rise of various cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin being a most prominent example. How does it work? What advantages does it give? What problems do they solve? What problems can be solved that way? I want you to dive with me into the immutable world of blocks where I will explain everything, from a simple hash, through Merkle trees, up to implementing your own blockchain.

            description: Our job might be to build web applications, but we can't build apps that rely on networking if we don't know how these networks and the big network that connects them all (this thing called the Internet) actually work. I'll walk through the basics of networking, then dive a lot deeper (from TCP/UDP to IPv4/6, source/destination ports, sockets, DNS, switching, firewalling and even OSPF, VRRP and BGP). Prepare for an eye-opener when you realize how much a typical app relies on all of these (and many more) working flawlessly... and how you can prepare your app for failure in the chain.

            description: In this presentation we will look at storing complex data in a single field. Many noSQL solutions are created around this (such as Redis’ lists, sets and hashes; MongoDB’s records), and many relational database now also support storing complex data in a single field through specific data types (such as PostGreSQL’s JSONB or hstore). Each of the different database engines support different things, and handle these data types in different ways. In this session we compare the different approaches to storage, indexing and interactions with these data types in different databases.

            description: Automated testing is an incredibly useful tool for any developer. From emerging design with unit tests to preventing regression bugs with acceptance tests, getting a computer to run tests instead of testing manually is a huge step forward and saves vast amounts of time. Where do you start with automated testing? It's an intimidating topic and can be confusing to understand what all the techy speak means, let alone how you get going. But writing automated tests shouldn't be difficult, and can and should be part of your daily workflow once you understand exactly what to test, and how to test it. In this workshop, we'll introduce WHY and HOW you can get started with unit and acceptance tests, and touch on integration testing. By the end of the workshop, you'll understand how you can leverage automated testing in new and existing projects, and be ready to save time and energy when developing.

The difference is only in their approach towards the design of their code. It's a minor effort if done on time, with a huge impact on the overall development of the software. In this presentation, we'll focus on what distinguishes a good developer from a strong one and learn how to stand out from the crowd. After this presentation, you'd understand how to incorporate the SOLID principles in your daily work and design your code for extendibility. You'd learn how to write code in a way that will make it easy to go back to a feature you developed a year ago and extend it with additional functionality in minutes, not hours.

            bio: I have spent the last 13 years working in the software industry, I've written lots of different code including JavaScript, VB, C#, Bash, SQL and Python. I have spent the majority of my career writing PHP, I'm a massive fan of the community and attend many community events. I am currently a contractor and consultant specialising in PHP, Python and JavaScript. Prior to this I spent two and a half years at Breakthrough Media as Head of Technology where I managed a team of PHP developers working on WordPress and Laravel projects. Before Breakthrough I was a contractor and ran my own business. I had some success, I built an app that got my business mentioned in Mashable and on CNN, I then sold my business, and finally I nearly went bankrupt. It was a crazy, fun and depressing period. I learnt a lot though, for example, make sure you read and understand every line of a contract before you sign it. I'd advise everyone to try and run a business at some stage in their life. Overall I believe I have a great deal of insight and guidance to offer developers and aspiring technical managers. Not just based on my current role but also my previous business experience. I would love the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with a wider audience. You can find out more about me via the following resources, you'll note I also have a degree in History which I hope shows I'm a well rounded individual.

The talk is based around a live coding demo. The talk will: Explain the difference between tests that prove an application works and tests which aim to break the application logic - Highlight how test to break principles force developers to introduce logic to handle unexpected behaviour - Show how test to break principles result in more robust applications as developers write code that can only be used in one way - Encourage developers to apply test to break principles to all types of tests, including manual tests."

When my business moved to the cloud we learned that there are ways around many of these challenges, allowing you to move your application in a way which might not be best practice but which works and gives you a solid platform from which to advance and improve your cloud implementation. In this tutorial we'll look at key building blocks to put a LAMP application onto AWS, what might cause problems for your individual use cases and how to mitigate these. As well as basic plans to get you started we'll look at pathways to modify your application and train your team to take more advantage of cloud native features and adhere to infrastructure and security best practices in a way which allows you to keep running your team and your business."

            description: After days, weeks, or months of coding many developers don’t know how to gauge the quality of their code. I’ll introduce tools to grade, benchmark, and analyze PHP code in an automated fashion allowing developers to write better quality software. Then I’ll explain key metrics to help understand what may need to be refactored, and use code smells to point out bugs before end-users discover them. Attendees will see how to use these tools, know where to find them, and be able to implement them in their own workflows.

After a brief refresher on the basics, we'll take a look at some of these other aspects of cryptography including hash functions, elliptic curves and quantum cryptography. Then we'll take a look at some practical applications answering questions such as: can I trust a web of trust? or should I use a block chain for this?"

            description: Learning more than one programming language is key to becoming a better developer. It is like adding a new tool to your toolbox. The more tools you have, the easier and quicker you’ll be able to tackle whatever job you need to do. You’ll also be able to use the right tool for the job, and who doesn’t like that?! I picked up Go (golang) a few years ago as it was becoming more popular among developers. Coming from a PHP background, I had no idea what channels or goroutines were or how is concurrency different from parallelism. I’ve got to say, it was a whole new world. Very different, but very cool. I was hooked! By happy coincidence, my company was looking to rewrite a legacy PHP app in Go. It was over 2000 lines of procedural and messy PHP4 with more downtime than I’m willing to admit to. I took on this project, and soon enough we had a much faster, more maintainable and much more reliable app for our customers. Go gave us options we would not have in PHP. The goal of this talk is to give you a good idea of what Go is and how it compares with PHP. We’ll look at the language itself as well as the tooling and communities around it. Even if you’re not sold on Go by the end of it, I hope you’ll leave inspired to go out there and learn whatever language you wanted to look into next.

            description: "We're all familiar with things like HTTP codes and content types, but there's so much more we can do when developing an API to make life easier for consumers. How many times have you used an API only to find out that every endpoint is slightly different – some use `snake_case`, others `camelCase`, sometimes the field is called `id`, sometimes it’s `user_id`. How about pagination? Error responses? What about API documentation? Trying to standardise on all these things can kill an engineering team. There are so many options out there it’s difficult to know where to start. Come along and learn what works for our team! We’ll cover contentious topics (should the version be in the URL or a header?), lesser-known standards that are great (RFC 7807 springs to mind) and a couple of things that aren't an issue right up until they’re a really big issue (like pagination). <br><br>*** Please note this tutorial session is only 60 minutes long will not have hands on exercises."

            description: |
                Keeping your environments in sync has been a challenge for software development for a long time. Developers tend to install their own versions of languages, databases, services etc. Doing so manually results in not only inconsistencies between dev and prod, but also from developer to developer, resulting in the always wonderful "It works on my machine" syndrome. Various tools have strived to solve this problem - MAMP, XAMP, VirtualBox, Vargrant, Puppet, Chef, homestead, etc. These are all steps in the right direction, but they're often heavy and require developers to learn new skills to work with them. In this talk, I'll be showing you how to Dockerize a new or existing project in such a way that the developers that use the project barely even know they are using Docker. Getting a new dev up to speed on a new project with a factory fresh machine is literally just a matter of installing Docker and check out the source code. That's it! Some of the benefits you'll see from using this approach<ul><li>Onboard new devs in minutes.</li><li>Have projects with unique (often incompatible) dependencies on a single machine.</li><li>Dockerized environment that acts like natively installed tools</li><li>Version locking of the tech stack</li><li>Updates to dependencies automatically distributed to other developers</li><li>Easily extended into CI/CD</li></ul>

            description: Building REST APIs is becoming an ever more common task for PHP developers to do and whilst the task may often sound simple in that it involves reading some input, and getting (or persisting) to a data source and returning some JSON, there are a lot of common pitfalls and complications that you might encounter along the way. In this talk we'll look at how we can build a simple maintainable REST API using the Symfony components that can perform some simple operations in ways that are clean and simple.

            description: Database joins can be expensive and you can reduce dives into the indexes/data by using JSON columns. By loading data kept in smaller 'stub' tables into main tables it is possible to minimize joins for simple data like address, phone numbers, and the like in schemaless JSON documents. Yes, third normal form or better has advantages at many levels but it is a design that is costly for many-to-many relations! It is very easy to refactor data is is often stagnant or infrequently updated to take advantage of hybrid SQL/NoSQL databases to greatly increase overall query performance plus increase code readability. This approach can completely change your ideas on data architecture and provide easy mutability for future changes.
