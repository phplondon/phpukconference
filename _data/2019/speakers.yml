            description: Kubernetes, the flagship project from the Cloud Native Foundation, has become the de facto standard for running our container workloads. Unfortunately, Kubernetes is a fast moving, ever evolving, sea of complexity. From Pods to Deployments, ConfigMaps to Secrets, and PersistantVolumeClaims to StatefulSets; this workshop will get you on-course. In this workshop, David will walk you through a series of labs that will teach you everything you need to know to take your container based application and deploy it as a self-healing, redundant and resilient application on top of Kubernetes. Let's set sail.

            description: As a kid, did you have ambitions for the future? "When I grow up I want to become a ...". Maybe you wanted to become a fireman, an astronaut, a nurse, a teacher, a police officer? As you grow up these ideas evolve and get replaced with actual ambitions, actual hopes and dreams. These might be entirely different than your childhood dreams. But how do you reach these goals? How do you accomplish these dreams? By listening to your parents, friends, or teachers? By doing it yourself? Or maybe you have given up and settled for a watered down version of the career and life you envisioned? People often attribute success to luck, and lack of success to incompetence. But what if I told you it's all about controlling the variables? Luck is something that you can control in a way. The more you figure out the context, the key players, the relationships, the values, and the rules of the ecosystem in which you want to succeed, the easier it is to gain from it. The more variables you control, the easier it is to find potential opportunities and to bank on them. Maybe you didn't get lucky, maybe you just saw it coming, and prepared yourself for it. In this keynote talk, Thijs is going to share his experiences, his hopes, his dreams, and how he applies a positive mental attitude to level up in his career, and in life in general. This is not a growth hacking talk, but a simple set of tips and tricks to succeed, even if it seems like the odds are stacked against you.

            description: Over the years, software teams have questioned if PHP is a good choice for building web services. In this talk, I will share how we use PHP on the backend for Glu Mobile’s flagship mobile game Design Home, enabling it to regularly rank amongst the top free mobile games - both in downloads and grossing - since its launch in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store in Q4 2016. Design Home reaches over 1 million daily active users, serving over 100,000 requests per minute while maintaining a user base of over 30 million players. To date, over 1 billion designs have been made by players. We will deep dive into the thought processes, development, testing and deployment strategy, showcasing what we have achieved with PHP and why we love it and rely on it. My goal is to share with the community that, when done the right way, PHP can be used to build and maintain reliable, massively-scalable and high-performance backends using web services.

            description: 15 years ago, plain text password storing was normal with some using MD5. We look back now and wonder what we were thinking! With GDPR and people thinking more about personal details, its about time we caught up and started storing them securely. There are many uses for personal data and is often sought after by criminals for targeting people. How can you prevent your customers data being used in these attacks ? Encrypting your database is a fantastic way! PHP is the first language to have modern encryption built in to the core, This talk will show you how to use these methods to allow your data to be secure and also not lose the speed which you can currently search for this data in your application. This talk will touch on architecture and will be focused on MySQL although the same techniques can be used for any storage engine.

We work on the web building so much more than web pages but these rich, asynchronous applications can suffer from ailments that are difficult for us to see. This session is a tour through some of the best tools around for working with HTTP to observe interaction between components and diagnose problems. By knowing the tools at your disposal and the right job for each, you will be able to quickly and painlessly identify and fix HTTP-related problems - and then get to the pub on time! I mean, get the next thing done ;) Whether you're debugging a backend API, an asynchronous client request or an unexpected timeout, these are the tools you will want to have at hand.

I'll walk through the basics of networking, then dive a lot deeper (from TCP/UDP to IPv4/6, source/destination ports, sockets, DNS, switching, firewalling and even OSPF, VRRP and BGP). Prepare for an eye-opener when you realize how much a typical app relies on all of these (and many more) working flawlessly... and how you can prepare your app for failure in the chain.

            description: In this presentation we will look at storing complex data in a single field. Many noSQL solutions are created around this (such as Redis’ lists, sets and hashes; MongoDB’s records), and many relational database now also support storing complex data in a single field through specific data types (such as PostGreSQL’s JSONB or hstore). Each of the different database engines support different things, and handle these data types in different ways. In this session we compare the different approaches to storage, indexing and interactions with these data types in different databases.

            bio: Gary Hockin pretends to write high-quality web applications as a senior developer at the BBC. He is a talented and evocative speaker, a cultivated author of impressively entertaining blog posts, and records elegant and informative screencasts and videos. Gary's also a contributor to the Zend Framework and is argumentative enough to be on the community review team. When Gary had a real job, he was a developer of at least competent standard with nearly 20 years experience. When not developing, speaking about developing, reading about developing or writing about developing, Gary enjoys playing computer games and arguing with his wife and two kids. Gary has recently discovered that conferences ask speakers to write their own biography text, and you can get away with writing pretty much anything you want.

            description: Automated testing is an incredibly useful tool for any developer. From emerging design with unit tests to preventing regression bugs with acceptance tests, getting a computer to run tests instead of testing manually is a huge step forward and saves vast amounts of time. Where do you start with automated testing? It's an intimidating topic and can be confusing to understand what all the techy speak means, let alone how you get going. But writing automated tests shouldn't be difficult, and can and should be part of your daily workflow once you understand exactly what to test, and how to test it. In this workshop, we'll introduce WHY and HOW you can get started with unit and acceptance tests, and touch on integration testing. By the end of the workshop, you'll understand how you can leverage automated testing in new and existing projects, and be ready to save time and energy when developing.

The difference is only in their approach towards the design of their code. It's a minor effort if done on time, with a huge impact on the overall development of the software. In this presentation, we'll focus on what distinguishes a good developer from a strong one and learn how to stand out from the crowd. After this presentation, you'd understand how to incorporate the SOLID principles in your daily work and design your code for extendibility. You'd learn how to write code in a way that will make it easy to go back to a feature you developed a year ago and extend it with additional functionality in minutes, not hours.

            bio: I have spent the last 13 years working in the software industry, I've written lots of different code including JavaScript, VB, C#, Bash, SQL and Python. I have spent the majority of my career writing PHP, I'm a massive fan of the community and attend many community events. I am currently a contractor and consultant specialising in PHP, Python and JavaScript. Prior to this I spent two and a half years at Breakthrough Media as Head of Technology where I managed a team of PHP developers working on WordPress and Laravel projects. Before Breakthrough I was a contractor and ran my own business. I had some success, I built an app that got my business mentioned in Mashable and on CNN, I then sold my business, and finally I nearly went bankrupt. It was a crazy, fun and depressing period. I learnt a lot though, for example, make sure you read and understand every line of a contract before you sign it. I'd advise everyone to try and run a business at some stage in their life. Overall I believe I have a great deal of insight and guidance to offer developers and aspiring technical managers. Not just based on my current role but also my previous business experience. I would love the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with a wider audience. You can find out more about me via the following resources, you'll note I also have a degree in History which I hope shows I'm a well rounded individual.

The talk is based around a live coding demo. The talk will: Explain the difference between tests that prove an application works and tests which aim to break the application logic - Highlight how test to break principles force developers to introduce logic to handle unexpected behaviour - Show how test to break principles result in more robust applications as developers write code that can only be used in one way - Encourage developers to apply test to break principles to all types of tests, including manual tests."

            description: "There are a great many reasons your application can benefit from moving to the cloud, but enough requirements for retraining, uncertainty around cost or complexity and just plain worry about what can go wrong to delay or prevent such a move. When my business moved to the cloud we learned that there are ways around many of these challenges, allowing you to move your application in a way which might not be best practice but which works and gives you a solid platform from which to advance and improve your cloud implementation. In this tutorial we'll look at key building blocks to put a LAMP application onto AWS, what might cause problems for your individual use cases and how to mitigate these. As well as basic plans to get you started we'll look at pathways to modify your application and train your team to take more advantage of cloud native features and adhere to infrastructure and security best practices in a way which allows you to keep running your team and your business."

            description: Learning more than one programming language is key to becoming a better developer. It is like adding a new tool to your toolbox. The more tools you have, the easier and quicker you’ll be able to tackle whatever job you need to do. You’ll also be able to use the right tool for the job, and who doesn’t like that?! I picked up Go (golang) a few years ago as it was becoming more popular among developers. Coming from a PHP background, I had no idea what channels or goroutines were or how is concurrency different from parallelism. I’ve got to say, it was a whole new world. Very different, but very cool. I was hooked! By happy coincidence, my company was looking to rewrite a legacy PHP app in Go. It was over 2000 lines of procedural and messy PHP4 with more downtime than I’m willing to admit to. I took on this project, and soon enough we had a much faster, more maintainable and much more reliable app for our customers. Go gave us options we would not have in PHP. The goal of this talk is to give you a good idea of what Go is and how it compares with PHP. We’ll look at the language itself as well as the tooling and communities around it. Even if you’re not sold on Go by the end of it, I hope you’ll leave inspired to go out there and learn whatever language you wanted to look into next.

I'm a fanatic when it comes to automation and quality code. I love sharing my knowledge and experience with my peers and helping other breaks into the industry.

                Keeping your environments in sync has been a challenge for software development for a long time. Developers tend to install their own versions of languages, databases, services etc. Doing so manually results in not only inconsistencies between dev and prod, but also from developer to developer, resulting in the always wonderful ""It works on my machine"" syndrome.
                Various tools have strived to solve this problem: MAMP, XAMP, VirtualBox, Vargrant, Puppet, Chef, homestead, etc. These are all steps in the right direction, but they're often heavy and require developers to learn new skills to work with them.
                In this talk, I'll be showing you how to Dockerize a new or existing project in such a way that the developers that use the project barely even know they are using Docker. Getting a new dev up to speed on a new project with a factory fresh machine is literally just a matter of installing Docker and check out the source code. That's it!
                Some of the benefits you'll see from using this approach:
                <ul><li>Onboard new devs in minutes.</li>
                <li>Have projects with unique (often incompatible) dependencies on a single machine.</li>
                <li>Dockerized environment that acts like natively installed tools</li>
                <li>Version locking of the tech stack</li>
                <li>Updates to dependencies automatically distributed to other developers</li>
                <li>Easily extended into CI/CD"</li></ul>

            description: "This prototype works, but it’s not pretty, and now it’s in production. That legacy application really needs some TLC. Where do we start? When creating long lived applications, it’s imperative to focus on good practices. The solution is to improve the whole development life cycle; from planning, better coding and testing, to automation, peer review and more. In this tutorial, we’ll take a deep dive into each of these areas, looking at how we can make positive, actionable change in our workflow. This workshop intends to improve your skills in planning, documenting, some aspects of development, testing and delivery of software for both legacy and greenfield projects. The workshop is made up of multiple exercises, allowing dynamic exploration into the various aspects of the software development life cycle. In each practical exercise, we'll brainstorm and investigate solutions, ensuring they are future-proofed, well tested and lead to the ultimate goal of confidence in delivering stable software."

            description: Database joins can be expensive and you can reduce dives into the indexes/data by using JSON columns. By loading data kept in smaller 'stub' tables into main tables it is possible to minimize joins for simple data like address, phone numbers, and the like in schemaless JSON documents. Yes, third normal form or better has advantages at many levels but it is a design that is costly for many-to-many relations! It is very easy to refactor data is is often stagnant or infrequently updated to take advantage of hybrid SQL/NoSQL databases to greatly increase overall query performance plus increase code readability. This approach can completely change your ideas on data architecture and provide easy mutability for future changes.
