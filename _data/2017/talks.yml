    Docker, the hottest technology around at the moment. It swept the Ops world by storm in 2014, became mainstream in 2015, and now it’s set to dominate the developer world, in 2016. Docker is a tool that allows you to package your application up into a single-runnable distributable binary - akin to the phar, but in Hulk mode. Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production. In this tutorial I will pull back the curtain and show you how Docker works and the technologies that make it all possible. We'll dive into Docker Image Layering and optimisation, Docker Networking, Docker Plugins and orchestrating containers at scale with Docker Swarm.

    Everyone must migrate to PHP 7, take advantage of exceptional performances, cut half their hardware and enjoy the best of PHP ever. This workshop is for everyone that is still eyeing PHP 7 while  with PHP 5, and wants to review his million LOC project before jumping to PHP 7. When migrating, we need to check old code and target only the interesting issues. This session will connect the backward incompatibilities and new features to actual location in the code, relying on static analysis to process quickly large code base. Based on the accumulated experience of the tools and our own, we'll review the issues, diagnose criticality, select the best fixes and prioritize the tasks.  All tools are Open Source, and ready to be integrated into your project life.

    PHP's stateless execution model is still based on the mechanics of CGI: request in, response out. This simplicity also means overhead on each request from frameworks starting up; applications also cannot interact with the request body during transmission, e.g. for streaming the body or handling upgrades to Websockets. That's why all other web languages now offer production ready web servers implemented purely in each language: Jetty, Puma, Gunicorn and friends use a modern process model and standardized middleware protocols. PHP 7 finally brought some necessary engine changes like catchable fatal errors, so there now is no longer a need for Apache or Nginx: event based HTTP components from projects like ReactPHP or Icicle, brought together by a server like Aerys or PHP-PM, start a framework once, and handle requests in a loop. The result is a massive gain in performance especially with frameworks like Symfony, and the potential for new features that previously were not possible with an external web server in front of an application. Let's explore the current state of affairs, the solutions other programming languages found, and the bright new future that's ahead for PHP, which, as always, will require sacrifices to be made.

Many of these projects have outgrown their humble beginnings as blogs or websites and are now highly customised web applications. However the modern tools we use as PHP developers can be tricky to utilise with the popular blogging platform. This technical talk will guide you through how to make the use of Git, Composer, and other tools familiar to PHP developers within your WordPress install - and help you take back control of your themes, plug-ins, database and environments in a growing application.

What would you think if you have the connectivity wherever your IoT sensor is, your own independent cloud based network, extremely scalable and globally distributed. Nowadays SIM cards and endpoints can be easily managed in real-time via an intuitive user-interface or an easy-to-integrate API. The developing process, security issues and key features will be discussed together with lots of real working IoT use cases based on PHP.

    You've written an application and now the worst thing that can happen to you has come about - People are using it! You now have load spikes to deal with. You can scale up to deal with the excess traffic, but what do you do when your load is variable? How do you do that, and stay on budget? This session is a case study on getting an App Engine app to scale to serve 30,000,000 requests an hour.  It will take you through the architecture, the code changes and the technology trade offs to get to that level of traffic. And how to make sure your app scales down so running infrastructure to deal with potential traffic doesn't drown you.

A lot of refactoring is required, but management keeps pushing for new features. How to proceed? Using examples and lessons learned from a real-world case, I'll show you how to replace a legacy application with a modern service-oriented architecture and build a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to deliver value from the first sprint. On the way, we’ll take a look at the process, automated testing, monitoring, master/trunk based development and various tips and best practices.

For the object-oriented programming novice who hears this term for the first time, the Wikipedia article gives a high-level overview, but advice and information about what ""SOLID"" really means on a practical level can be hard to come across. This talk aims to clarify what the SOLID principles are and how you can apply them in your work, with the aim of producing easier-to-maintain, de-coupled code with fewer smells. I'll show you PHP examples of each of the five SOLID principles, talk about when and how to implement them in your applications and give you a few other hints about ways you can improve your OOP design.

Fast-forward to now and you'll see me standing in front of audiences all around the world talking to developers about numerous topics."Why are you bragging like that at me?" I hear you ask. Because it could happen to you too. The question I always ask myself is ""How the hell did that happen?!?!"". The truth is that the only reason I've managed to advance my career so far in a decade is because of the people that make up the communities of open source projects. Not only do open source projects save you time and money, but the friendships and support groups that can be made within these communities is, frankly, staggering. Join me as I chart my journey from wage slave to conference speaker, and look at how you can leverage the power of open source to make real friends, real money, and real happiness.

Let’s delve into the weird and wonderful parlance that computer scientists and developers have created for themselves. Whether the words are borrowed or just plain made up, I’ll uncover how they made their way into the vocabulary of the modern programmer. In this session, you’ll learn everything from etymology to history to broader definitions, all of which can help you understand what the heck that person’s rambling about. So, the next time you’re in conversation, you’ll be the one discussing dependency injection versus inversion of control with ease.

How do you create deployment artefacts which are built with consistency and transparency? How do you manage environment variables between staging and production environments? How do you perform actions / schedule processes in one environment and not another?

    High availability is becoming a de-facto requirement of today's applications. Customer-facing IT failures mean directly losing customer revenue and trust, as users have grown accustomed to easily switching service providers for more reliable ones. Lack of internal systems availability block employee productivity and add to the financial burden. Thus, it is critical to have a healthy, performant, resilient IT structure serving as a backbone of conducting your business. But there are no textbook solutions to achieving five 9s availability. Data redundancy, computing clusters, load balancing, fail-over mechanisms, each of these individually addresses one potential issue, but none treats systems in your organisation holistically for maximising business revenue. Silos are a clever method of grouping servers in such a way that they can be scaled both horizontally and vertically, depending on the actual application needs. Most importantly, it frees you from over-optimizing the architecture upfront, by allowing fine adjustments easy to integrate in your Agile workflow.

    At one time or another, every developer comes across the same problem - their application starts getting slower, then starts falling over, then isn't available at all. Often, this comes down to too many users, too much stored data - in other words a scaling problem. Looking at a range of options, from horizontal and vertical scaling, to caching, sharding and optimisation, Liam will discuss approaches to scaling that can be used on new applications, and also some that can be retro-fitted to existing applications.

    MediaWiki is a well known open source wiki framework mostly written on PHP. Most PHP developers are aware of MediaWiki but sometimes it is more than just reading manual that is needed. The evaluation of mediawiki, the history, how a number of volunteers invested their time to make this popular open source framework will be briefed during the session. How anyone can get involved as a mediawiki developer. Understanding the APIs, installing mediawiki and running php bots on mediawiki powered websites, including Wikipedia. How anyone can make extensions and parser functions on mediawiki that could support programming languages like Lua. Why using mediawiki for enterprises is a bad idea are some aspects will be talked.

    Websockets are a technology allowing bi-directional communication between the server and the client and are not often the topic of focus when it comes to writing standard web applications due to their architectural complexity and learning curve required. This talk is the story of my first real project involving sending torrent data from the server to the browser so I could build my own Torrent Web GUI. What is an event loop? How does it work? How about authentication when using both HTTP and Websocket requests? How do I make my code non-blocking? These are some of the topics covered from both a theoretical and a practical standpoint. I also talk about security and privacy and how not to get caught when setting up a server designed solely for streaming Ubuntu downloads.

    Software bugs are inevitable; some are especially difficult to track down, causing you to waste countless hours before throwing your hands up in defeat. It doesn't have to be this way! The mental fatigue and wasted time can be avoided by using strategies like identifying the most-appropriate tool, taking a logical & objective approach, challenging assumptions, listening to variables, isolating the code path, and reinforcing code with automated tests. Attendees will learn how to combine these techniques with the right mindset and attitude in order to debug their code quickly and effectively.

    Decoupling, abstracting and ungluing your applications has been something that people have been talking about for years. Ultimately though, most packages still have dependencies and creating a library-abstract bundle is still hard but it's getting easier. How far are we from having the ability to package re-usable web-focussed widgets that can be composed into applications? What would a world where libraries were all non-framework specific that could be glued in look like? Lets have a look at how far we've come as an industry and what the future could hold.
