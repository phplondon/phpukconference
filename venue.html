                <p>PHP UK conference is in a new venue this year, <a href="http://www.thebrewery.co.uk/">The Brewery</a>, right in the heart of the City of London. The Brewery occupies the site of the former Whitbread brewery in East London. Samuel Whitbread opened The Brewery in 1750. Brewing on the site continued until 1976.</p>

                <p>The Brewery is a beautiful venue, with unique rooms and ambient lighting which provide the perfect creative atmosphere, encouraging networking and learning. There will be dedicated space for delegates to relax, charge their equipment and network with other attendees.</p>

                <p>The centre of the conference will be the 544square metre exhibition and catering space. Buzzing with speakers, sponsors and delegates in this room you'll find all your refreshments, lunch and great info and swag from our awesome <a href="/sponsors">sponsors</a>.</p>

                <p>The whole venue is equipped with award winning wifi free for all attendees. Each talk room contains state of the art audio and video equipment so you know you'll get the best possible experience out of all the talks, including in the recorded video after the event.</p>

     		<p>We have visited and inspected a number of hotels in the direct vicinity of the Brewery - we looked at rooms in each one and have selected three that we believe represent excellent value for conference accommodation.
     		 There are many other hotels in the area including, of course, <a href="http://www.thistle.com/en/hotels/united_kingdom/london/thistle_city_barbican/index.html" target-"_blank">the Montcalm</a> which is located in the conference centre.</p>
     		Other local hotels are shown of the Brewery site <a href="http://www.thebrewery.co.uk/Where-to-stay-nearby" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
     		<p>Note: Delegates would be well advised to book accommodation as soon as possible. London hotels tend to be fully booked - especially as we are running at the end of London Fashion Week.
