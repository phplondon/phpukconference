      <h2>ACCOMMODATION</h2>
   		<div class="twelvcol">
     		<p>We have visited and inspected a number of hotels in the direct vicinity of the Brewery - we looked at rooms in each one and have selected three that we believe represent excellent value for conference accommodation.
        There are many other hotels in the area including, of course, <a href="http://www.thistle.com/en/hotels/united_kingdom/london/thistle_city_barbican/index.html" target-"_blank">the Montcalm</a> which is located in the conference centre.</p>
     		<p>Other local hotels are shown of the Brewery site <a href="http://www.thebrewery.co.uk/Where-to-stay-nearby" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
     		<p>Note: Delegates would be well advised to book accommodation as soon as possible. London hotels tend to be fully booked - especially as we are running at the end of London Fashion Week.
