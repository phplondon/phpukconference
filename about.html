<h1><img class="left-ribbon" src="/assets/images/TitleRibbonLeft.png" />ABOUT THE CONFERENCE<img class="right-ribbon" src="/assets/images/TitleRibbonRight.png"/></h1>
<p><a href="http://phplondon.org">PHP London</a> are pleased to announce the 8th Annual PHP UK conference; a 2-day event with 4 great tracks held at at <a href="http://www.thebrewery.co.uk" alt="The Brewery Event Venue" title="The Brewery Event Venue">The Brewery</a>, in the heart of the City of London.</p>

<p>With over 600 delegates, speakers, and sponsors, PHP UK conference aims to deliver fantastic up to date content about PHP and related web technologies in a comfortable and professional setting. There are countless networking opportunities to engage with international speakers and delegates, which makes the event one you won't want to miss.</p>

<p>Anyone is welcome to attend the event, whether you're a professional web developer, hobbyist, manager, or just starting out, there's something for everyone.</p>

<p>The event kicks off on Thursday evening with a special pubcon sponsored by PHP London. Each day will then start with an inspiring keynote presentation, followed by your choice of 3 tracks of talks or unconference sessions. Each day will close with a panel session followed by the evening's social event. There's also exhibition space for all sponsors, to fill in the spaces in between.</p>

<p>PHP UK Conference was started in 2006 with the aim to offer the local PHP community access to industry updates and professional development at an affordable rate. The conference is run solely by volunteer members of the PHP London community. Costs are minimised to keep ticket prices as low as possible, and any surplus funds are used to fund community events throughout the year and to fund the following years' conference.</p>

<p>The whole conference is run by volunteers - on the two days of the conference the following people will be running reception, looking after rooms and handling general queries. 
We'd like to say a huge thankyou to them for giving up their time!</p>
