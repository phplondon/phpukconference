15 years ago, plain text password storing was normal with some using MD5. We look back now and wonder what we were thinking! With GDPR and people thinking more about personal details, its about time we caught up and started storing them securely. There are many uses for personal data and is often sought after by criminals for targeting people. How can you prevent your customers data being used in these attacks ? Encrypting your database is a fantastic way! PHP is the first language to have modern encryption built in to the core, This talk will show you how to use these methods to allow your data to be secure and also not lose the speed which you can currently search for this data in your application. This talk will touch on architecture and will be focused on MySQL although the same techniques can be used for any storage engine.
