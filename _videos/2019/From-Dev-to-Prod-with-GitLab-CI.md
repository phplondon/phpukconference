Continuous Delivery Pipeline as code is key helping you to ensure long term maintainability. Treating your pipeline as code helps you to version it in your SCM of choice, makes changes easily traceable and lets anyone on your team make required changes. In this session I will show you how we build and maintain our Continuous Delivery pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, Docker, Nexus and Traefik. Together we will take a deep dive into the GitLab CI Build Pipelines to build and deploy docker containers to dev, stage and production environments.
