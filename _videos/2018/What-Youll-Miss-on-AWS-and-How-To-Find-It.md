AWS is exciting & provides a boost to your app's availability, scalability and security. But moving from traditional hosting to the cloud can change how you develop, deploy & manage infrastructure. We can use old & new tools to smooth the migration, getting the power of the cloud without the pain! In the talk we will look over 9 things you'll miss on AWS and how to get them back. We'll cover auto scaling, load balancing, networked file systems, PHP opcache, Lambda functions, databases, logging, & queues - giving you a pathway to AWS operation with minimal changes to your application, keeping the cost down and the productivity high!
