This talk will focus on how Impostor Syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect work to undermine our estimation of our individual skills as developers. Who do these cognitive biases affect? And how do they collectively shape the face of the software development industry? The impact of these biases on personal and professional relationships among individuals and groups will be examined, along with what can be done to diagnose and cope with them.
