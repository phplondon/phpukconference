ZF3 is the framework that took the opportunity to learn from the previous 4 years of ZF2 and be even better than that!  Today's PHP projects are built of components installed via Composer and ZF3's architecture reflects this approach; its core components have also been greatly improved in both usage and performance from older versions of the framework.  If you're already running a ZF2 application, you'll be able to upgrade your existing application and there will be some excellent support for doing so - we love it when developers get to use new things.  We'll also look at how PSR-7 and middleware has been embraced. If you want to learn what's new in the world of Zend Framework, then this session is for you.
