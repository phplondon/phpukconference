This session will cover Regular Expressions from the basics to the darkest corners of this arcane art.

Regular Expressions at the core come in handy to achieve validation and text manipulation tasks. In the day to day life of a developer, becoming comfortable with them opens up many more use cases.

As one of the tortured souls that actually enjoys writing - and reading - regexes, Jordi will share his passion so that you too can see there is no reason to worry.
