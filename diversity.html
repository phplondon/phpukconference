	<h1>Diversity</h1>
	<p>PHP UK Conference is dedicated to improving diversity in the technology industry. Over the past few years, we've taken steps towards making PHP UK a welcoming and inclusive event for all attendees. Some of the changes we've implemented are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>2014 - Created a <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> for all PHP London events</li>
		<li>2015 - Revised Call for Papers process to include anonymised voting</li>
		<li>2016 - Scholarship programme launch, results posted in March 2016</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>PHP UK Conference Scholarship Programme</h2>
	
		<p>PHP UK's scholarship program provides aide to members of underrepresented groups who may not otherwise be able to attend our conference for financial reasons.</p>
	
	<h3>Fundraising Progress</h3>
	<p>Our target for PHP UK 2016 is to provide access to 50 or more scholarship awardees. This requires £50,000 in funds to be raised to support the scholarships.</p>
	
	Current funds raised: £5553.19 / £50,000

	<h2>Scholarship Award</h2>
	<p>Total value of each scholarship is £1,000. This provides the awardee with:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>£300 - Full conference ticket to both days</li>
		<li>Up to £700 in travel and accommodation stipend</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each scholarship recipient will also be appointed a mentor that can help familiarize the awardee with the conference.</p>
	<p>Cash will not be awarded to the recipients. PHP UK will arrange tickets, travel and accommodation on behalf of awardees. If a given awardee does not use the full value of the scholarship, any surplus funds will be put back into the scholarship fund and distributed to additional awardees. 100% of all donations to the scholarship fund will go directly to awardees.</p>

	<h2>Eligibility</h2>
	<p>Applicants should be a member of an underrepresented group in technology - women, minorities, LGBTQIA, people with disabilities, or other underrepresented groups - and be unable to attend without financial assistance.</p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>Our target for PHP UK 2016 is to provide access to 50 or more scholarship awardees. This requires £50,000 in funds to be raised to support the scholarships.</p>
	<p>With a total attendance of 700 delegates, 50 scholarship awardees is just 8% of the total attendance. At PHP UK 2015 we had just 6.7% attendance from delegates identifying as female, without a scholarship programme available.</p>

	<h2>Guidelines</h2>
	<p>Scholarships are awarded based on random selection. Neither the date you applied nor the content of your application will affect the outcome of your application, although those who apply earliest will have the most opportunities to be chosen. Selection will be made randomly and anonymously by an assembled group of reviewers who will assess each applicant's request. </p>
	<p>If you are employed, and your employer is able to sponsor your travel, we can list them as a scholarship sponsor.</p>
	
	<h2>Mentors</h2>
	<p>Each scholarship awardee will be paired with a mentor to help familiarize the awardee with the conference. Anyone who is already attending the event can volunteer to be a mentor, just fill out the application form below.</p>
